# CTF-Writeups  

Hello   

This repo is my personal collection of **CTF writeups**,basically a place where I break down interesting challenges I’ve solved, whether from **online CTF platforms or real-life competitions**. If you're into cybersecurity, hacking challenges/CTFs, or just curious about how these challenges work, you're in the right place!  

## Why am I doing this

- **To learn** – Writing stuff down helps me remember it better.  
- **To share** – Maybe my approach helps someone else. 
- **To keep track** – Some challenges are too hard to remember, and I don’t want to forget how I solved them.  

## What you’ll find here  

A mix of **Web, Crypto, Forensics, Pwn, Reverse engineering, and Misc** challenges, all neatly organized. 

## What’s in each writeup?  

Each writeup includes the following details:  

- **The challenge name & category**  
- **How hard it was** (subjectively)  
- **What the problem was about**  
- **How I approached it**  
- **Step-by-step solution** (with any scripts I wrote)  
- **What I learned from it**


## Wanna chat or contribute?  

If you have a better way to solve something, found a mistake, or just want to discuss a challenge,open an issue, submit a pull request, or hit me up on discord  `zervle` . Cybersecurity is all about sharing and getting better together. 

## Disclaimer  

This is for **educational purposes only**. If you’re playing a live CTF, **don’t cheat** .These writeups are meant to help people learn,not to give free answers in active competitions, But you can get some inspiration from the challenges in your CTFs.

That’s all for now, If this helps you, thats great . If you have feedback, even better. Happy hacking, and don't forget to share with everyone
