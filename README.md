# CTF-Writeups  

Hello ðŸ‘‹  

This repo is my personal collection of **CTF writeups**â€”basically a place where I break down interesting challenges Iâ€™ve solved, whether from **online CTF platforms or real-life competitions**. If you're into cybersecurity, hacking challenges/CTFs, or just curious about how these challenges work, you're in the right place!  

## Why am I doing this

- **To learn** â€“ Writing stuff down helps me remember it better.  
- **To share** â€“ Maybe my approach helps someone else. 
- **To keep track** â€“ Some challenges are too hard to remember, and I donâ€™t want to forget how I solved them.  

## What youâ€™ll find here  

A mix of **Web, Crypto, Forensics, Pwn, Reverse engineering, and Misc** challenges, all neatly organized. 

## Whatâ€™s in each writeup?  

Each writeup includes the following details:  

- **The challenge name & category**  
- **How hard it was** (subjectively)  
- **What the problem was about**  
- **How I approached it**  
- **Step-by-step solution** (with any scripts I wrote)  
- **What I learned from it**


## Wanna chat or contribute?  

If you have a better way to solve something, found a mistake, or just want to discuss a challenge,open an issue, submit a pull request, or hit me up on discord  `zervle` . Cybersecurity is all about sharing and getting better together. 

## Disclaimer  

This is for **educational purposes only**. If youâ€™re playing a live CTF, **donâ€™t cheat** .These writeups are meant to help people learn,not to give free answers in active competitions, But you can get some inspiration from the challenges in your CTFs.

Thatâ€™s all for now, If this helps you, thats great . If you have feedback, even better. Happy hacking, and don't forget to share with everyone
