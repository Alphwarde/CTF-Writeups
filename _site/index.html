      <h1 id="ctf-writeups">CTF-Writeups</h1>

<p>Hello ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>This repo is my personal collection of <strong>CTF writeups</strong>â€”basically a place where I break down interesting challenges Iâ€™ve solved, whether from <strong>online CTF platforms or real-life competitions</strong>. If youâ€™re into cybersecurity, hacking challenges/CTFs, or just curious about how these challenges work, youâ€™re in the right place!</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-doing-this">Why am I doing this</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>To learn</strong> â€“ Writing stuff down helps me remember it better.</li>
  <li><strong>To share</strong> â€“ Maybe my approach helps someone else.</li>
  <li><strong>To keep track</strong> â€“ Some challenges are too hard to remember, and I donâ€™t want to forget how I solved them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-youll-find-here">What youâ€™ll find here</h2>

<p>A mix of <strong>Web, Crypto, Forensics, Pwn, Reverse engineering, and Misc</strong> challenges, all neatly organized.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-each-writeup">Whatâ€™s in each writeup?</h2>

<p>Each writeup includes the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The challenge name &amp; category</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How hard it was</strong> (subjectively)</li>
  <li><strong>What the problem was about</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How I approached it</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Step-by-step solution</strong> (with any scripts I wrote)</li>
  <li><strong>What I learned from it</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wanna-chat-or-contribute">Wanna chat or contribute?</h2>

<p>If you have a better way to solve something, found a mistake, or just want to discuss a challenge,open an issue, submit a pull request, or hit me up. Cybersecurity is all about sharing and getting better together.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This is for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>. If youâ€™re playing a live CTF, <strong>donâ€™t cheat</strong> .These writeups are meant to help people learn,not to give free answers in active competitions, But you can get some inspiration from the challenges in your CTFs.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thatâ€™s all for now, If this helps you, thats great . If you have feedback, even better. Happy hacking, and donâ€™t forget to share with everyone</p>

<p><strong>â€” Homam</strong></p>
