# This challenge is what it looks like, you are prompted with "You've obtained a hashed password from a compromised leaked database.
The hash was generated using a common hashing algorithm, and the username and salt are available to you. 
Your task is to crack the original password and then log in to the website.
Once logged in, you'll be required to provide two different strings that hash to the same value, Has exploiting a hash collision.
Successfully submitting these two strings will grant you the flag.
NOTE: This challenge simulates a real-world attack scenario where attackers leverage hash collisions to bypass security systems and impersonate users."
